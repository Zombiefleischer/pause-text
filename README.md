A simple fork of the [pause-icon](https://gitlab.com/Freeze020/pause-icon/) module. It adds support for pause-text-lists. There are pregenerated ones, but you can add your own lines or change the existing ones.
You can also change the pause icon. Supported formats are jpg, png, webp and gif.

Now with text synchronization between players!

Dependencies:
- socketlib
